# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them.
# A route maps a URL path to a controller. It defines with what function
# or method will be called when a URL is accessed.
# If the user accesses http://drupal8.dev/csv/import, the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as a classname
# ("\Drupal\dawn_product_import\Controller\DawnController")
# and a method ("action").
dawn_product_import.dawn_controller_action:
  path: 'csv/import'
  defaults:
    _form: '\Drupal\dawn_product_import\Form\DawnCsvForm'
    _title: 'Dawn Csv Importer'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'access content'
#    _controller: '\Drupal\dawn_product_import\Controller\DawnController::action'
